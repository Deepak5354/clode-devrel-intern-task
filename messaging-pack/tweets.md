Developers: stop firefighting the same incidents. Use telemetry (eBPF, logs, traces) to feed automated runbooks — deploy → monitor → fix — with Clode’s AI orchestration. Fewer pages, faster restores.

Local testing (LocalStack) + AI deploy automation (Clode) = faster iteration and safer prod rollouts. Demo: wire localstack CI → Clode gate for zero-surprise promotion.

Platform teams: your IDP is great — but who fixes post-deploy incidents? Clode turns platform runbooks into executable automation so SREs can focus on design, not repeats.

Kubernetes cost spikes? Combine DevZero rightsizing with Clode orchestration to auto-apply recommended instance sizing & safe migrations — no downtime.

Want progressive delivery with fewer manual steps? Combine feature flags (DevCycle) + Clode workflows to automate staged rollouts and automatic rollback on SLO breaches.
