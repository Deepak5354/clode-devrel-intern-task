Founder(s): Matteo Collina (sheet) — prominent Node.js contributor.

Location: (distributed / OSS maintainer team) 
Platformatic

Primary category: Developer Tools / Platform Engineering primitives (Node.js runtime)

What they do (2–3 lines): Platformatic provides an open-source runtime and tooling that reduces time spent wiring Node.js microservices — standardized logging/tracing, runtimes, and production primitives to make Node services production-ready faster. Enterprise tools layer adds management and monitoring.

Target user (ICP): Node.js dev teams that want batteries-included runtimes and opinionated production defaults.

Key features (3–5 bullets):

Platformatic Runtime for running microservices with standard NFRs.

Positioning: “Focus on building apps, not infra plumbing — turnkey Node.js runtime.”

Where they overlap with Clode:

Both target developer productivity and standardizing production patterns.

Potential overlap in build/run automation for Node apps.

How Clode is different:

Platformatic is language/runtime specific (Node.js) with developer primitives; Clode is cross-language/cloud and focused on cloud deployment automation and AI-runbook automation across the stack.

DevRel angle: Create a “Platformatic + Clode quickstart” for Node teams that want opinionated runtime + automated deploy/monitoring pipelines.

2 content hooks:

“3-minute deploy pipeline for Node: Platformatic runtime + Clode automation.”

“How to stop rewriting production plumbing — combine runtime + automation.”
