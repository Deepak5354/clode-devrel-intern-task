11) Configu

Company name: Configu

Website: https://configu.com/
 (note: some smaller sites may have lighter docs; use site directly)

Founder(s): Piotr Dabkowski (sheet)

Location: (per sheet)

Primary category: Developer Tools / Config Management (judging by name & site)

What they do (2–3 lines): Configu offers configuration management and infrastructure-as-code helpers (tooling to manage environment config, secrets, and templating across deployments). (verify on site)

Target user (ICP): DevOps and platform teams needing safer, consistent config management across environments.

Key features (3–5 bullets):

Centralized config templates and environment overlays.

Integration with CI/CD and secrets stores.

Policy and validation for config changes.

Pricing: Likely freemium or SaaS + enterprise (site).

Positioning: “Make config boring & safe” (hypothetical, check site for tagline).

Where they overlap with Clode:

Config management is a core input to automated deployments; Clode needs canonical config to safely automate deployments.

How Clode is different:

Configu focuses specifically on config lifecycle; Clode consumes config to automate full deploys & operational actions.

DevRel angle: “Ship reliable infra — how to feed Configu into Clode pipelines for safe, automated rollouts.”

2 content hooks:

“Canonical config + AI-runbooks = safer production changes.”

“How Clode uses validated config layers to avoid config drift.”

Note: Configu has fewer public docs than the others; include CI/CD integration examples during evaluation if asked.
