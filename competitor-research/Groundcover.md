Where they overlap with Clode:

Both address operational visibility and reliability; groundcover supplies data/insight Clode could use to drive automated remediation or AI-driven runbooks.

How Clode is different:

Groundcover focuses on data collection/observability; Clode uses automation on top of telemetry to take actions, runbooks, or changes.

DevRel angle: Demo: “Use groundcover telemetry to power Clode’s automated incident remediation (example).”

2 content hooks:

“eBPF telemetry → automated fix: how to close the loop with Clode.”

“BYOC observability + AI remediation: security and compliance patterns.”
