Where they overlap with Clode:

Both streamline deploy workflows and developer CI/CD experiences.

Overlap on build/deploy automation for web apps.

How Clode is different:

Netlify is focused on web hosting, previews, and edge functions (opinionated web stack). Clode is cloud-agnostic automation across diverse app types and deeper AI-driven operational automation (deploy→operate→monitor).

DevRel angle: Webinar: “When to use Netlify for web DX vs Clode for full-stack automation (and how to integrate both).”

2 content hooks:
