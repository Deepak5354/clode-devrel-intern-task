Where they overlap with Clode:

Both reduce manual release risk; DevCycle handles feature gating, Clode could orchestrate deployment rollouts tied to flags and automate remediation.

How Clode is different:

DevCycle focuses on feature flag control and experimentation; Clode focuses on automating deployment pipelines and operational actions (including hooks that could respond to flag states).

DevRel angle: Integration guide: “Use Clode to tie deploy strategies to DevCycle flags for safe progressive delivery.”

2 content hooks:

“Progressive delivery pipelines: DevCycle + Clode example.”

“How to wire flags into automated rollback runbooks.”
