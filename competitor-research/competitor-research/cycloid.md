Where they overlap with Clode:

Both target platform engineering and aim to automate infra and developer workflows.

Overlap in automation and self-service goals.

How Clode is different:

Cycloid is an IDP portal focused on team-facing UX and workflow orchestration; Clode is an AI-first automation engine that automates tasks across deploy → operate → monitor (including runbooks, autoscaling decisions, cloud infra changes).

Clode’s AI capabilities can proactively recommend or execute changes; Cycloid’s value is in the orchestrated portal & governance layer.

DevRel angle: Content showing migration patterns: “When do you build your own IDP vs. use an AI automation layer?” Use concrete checklists and playbooks.

2 content hooks:

“IDP vs AI-automation: real teams’ paths from Cycloid to Clode.”

“Platform engineering checklist: Add AI-runbooks to your Cycloid portal.”
